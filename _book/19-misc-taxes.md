# Miscellaneous Taxes 2018

This section includes a number of taxes and exemptions that are  not  covered  in  the  previous  sections:  the  local  option  sales and use tax, the bank franchise tax, the communication sales and use tax, the short-term (daily) rental tax, and other miscellaneous  taxes.  The  local  option  sales  tax  has  been  adopted by every city and county and, by law, all use the same tax rate. Also, as explained below, counties must share a portion of sales tax collections with incorporated towns within  their  boundaries.  Wherever  the  bank  franchise  tax  is imposed, the rate is the same. In addition to those major taxes, this section covers the communications sales and use tax and other miscellaneous taxes for which information was provided on the survey form when local governments were asked to specify any miscellaneous taxes that fell outside the scope of the survey questions.

## LOCAL OPTION AND STATE SALES AND USE TAXES

In fiscal year 2018, the most recent year available from the Auditor of Public Accounts, the local option sales and use tax accounted for 8.0 percent of local tax revenue for cities, 6.4 percent for counties and 9.2 percent for large towns. These are averages; the relative importance of taxes in individual cities, counties and towns may vary significantly. For information on individual localities, see Appendix C. 

Each  city  and  county  is  permitted  by  §  58.1-605  to  establish a general retail sales tax, “at the rate of 1 percent to provide revenue for the general fund of such city or county.” This tax applies to dealers with a retail presence in Virginia. Sales of any items from such operations incur the 1 percent sales tax. Sales tax monies are then collected by the Virginia Department of Taxation and sent to the Department of the Treasury. That agency credits the accounts of the localities where  the  sales  occurred  and  disburses  the  monies  to  the  localities on a monthly basis (§ 58.1-605.F).

Cities  and  counties  are  also  permitted  to  establish  a  local use tax at the rate of 1 percent for the purpose of providing revenue to the general fund of the locality. The use tax is similar in purpose to the retail sales tax, but its aim is somewhat distinct: it applies to dealers that do not have a physical retail presence in Virginia. It is a tax levied on the use of tangible personal property within the state that has been stored or sold out-of-state.

Special  distribution  requirements  apply  to  counties  with  incorporated  towns  (§  58.1-605.G).  Where  the  town constitutes  a  special  school  division  and  is  operated  as  a  separate  school  division  under  a  town  school  board[^1],  the  county is required to pay to the town a proportionate share of the full amount of tax receipts based on the school age population  within  the  town  compared  to  the  school  age  population in the entire county. If the town does not constitute a separate school division, then one-half of county collections is distributed to the town based on the proportion of the school age population within the town to the school age  population  of  the  entire  county,  provided  the  town  complies with certain conditions.

Certain  items  are  exempted  from  the  state  sales  and  use tax and may be exempted from the local option sales and use tax also. Each locality is permitted by § 58.1-609 to exempt fuels meant for domestic consumption from the 1  percent  component  of  the  tax.  These  fuels  include  artificial or propane gas, firewood, coal, or home heating oil. Only 11 localities answered that they exempted such fuels from the tax. The localities were the counties of Alleghany, Campbell,  Madison,  Patrick,  Pittsylvania,  Prince  George  and Washington and the cities of Chesapeake, Covington,  Harrisonburg, and Portsmouth. 

The  state  portion  of  the  sales  and  use  tax  was  raised  from 4 percent to 4.3 percent effective  July 1, 2013. House Bill 2313, Chapter 766, further increased the amount by an additional 0.7 amount for localities in the Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads planning districts. The additional taxes do not apply to food purchased for human consumption. The Northern Virginia Planning District consists of the counties of  Arlington,  Fairfax,  Loudoun,  and  Prince  William  and  the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, Falls Church, Manassas, and Manassas Park. The Hampton Roads Planning District consists of the counties of Isle of Wight, James City, South-ampton, and York and the cities of Chesapeake, Franklin, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk, Poquoson, Portsmouth, Suffolk,  Virginia  Beach,  and  Williamsburg.  The  purpose  of this additional state tax is to fund the Northern Virginia Transportation Authority and the Hampton Roads Construction  Fund,  respectively.  Consequently,  the  new  sales  and  use rate is made up of a 1.0 percent local tax rate as well as a 4.3 state tax rate for most localities and a 5.0 percent state  tax  rate  for  localities  associated  with  transportation  commissions. 

## STATE MOTOR FUELS TAX ON DISTRIBUTORS
An additional state tax that applies only to specific localities is the fuel distribution license tax. It is a state tax on distributors of motor fuels to retailers in qualifying localities. Under § 58.1-2295 a state tax of 2.1 percent may be imposed  on  any  distributor  in  a  qualifying  locality  in  the  business  of  selling  fuels  at  wholesale  to  retail  dealers  for  retail  sale  within  the  qualifying  locality.  To  be  eligible  a  locality  must  be:  (i)  any  county  or  city  that  is  a  member  of a transportation district in which a rail commuter mass transport  system  and  a  bus  commuter  mass  transport  system are owned or operated by an agency as defined in § 15.2- 4502, or (ii) any county or city that is a member of a transportation district subject to § 15.2- 4515 and is contiguous to the Northern Virginia Transportation District. In addition, § 58.1-1722 excludes the amount of the tax imposed and collected by the distributor from the distributor’s gross receipts for purposes of BPOL taxes imposed under Chapter 37 (§ 58.1-3700 et seq.).

The 2.1 percent state tax is imposed in 11 localities that belong  to  two  transportation  commissions.  The  Northern  Virginia  Transportation  Commission  (NVTC)  consists  of  Fairfax, Loudoun, and Arlington counties and Alexandria, Fairfax, and Falls Church cities. The tax helps provide financial support for the activities of the Washington Metropolitan Area  Transit  Authority  (WMATA),  also  known  as  Metro,  and  the  Virginia  Railway  Express  (VRE),  the  commuter  line between Washington D.C. and Manassas and Fredericksburg. The other commission, the Potomac and Rappa-hannock  Transportation  Commission  (PRTC),  consists  of  three cities (Fredericksburg, Manassas, and Manassas Park), and two counties (Prince William and Stafford). It provides support to rail transport (VRE) in the affected counties and bus services originating in Prince William County through Omniride and Omnilink.

House Bill 2313, Chapter 766, authorized the state tax in certain localites in the Hampton Roads Planning District. These are the counties of Isle of Wight, James City, Southampton, and York, and the cities of Chesapeake, Hampton, Franklin, Newport News, Norfolk, Suffolk, Virginia Beach, Williamsburg,  Poquoson,  and  Portsmouth.  The  tax  began  on July 1, 2013.

## BANK FRANCHISE TAX
The  bank  franchise  tax,  also  known  as  the  bank  stock  tax,  accounted  for  0.7  percent  of  city  tax  revenue  in fiscal  year  2018,  0.5  percent  of  county  tax  revenue,  and 4.2 percent of the tax revenue of large towns. These are averages; the relative importance of taxes in individual cities, counties, and towns may vary significantly. For information on individual localities, see Appendix C.

The state of Virginia levies a bank franchise tax on all banks in Virginia at a rate of \$1 on each $100 of net capital (§  58.1-1204).  Net  capital  is  defined  and  its  computation  explained  in  §  58.1-1205. According  to  this  section,  net  capital is determined by adding together a bank’s capital, surplus, undivided profits, and one half of any reserve for loan losses net of applicable deferred tax to obtain gross capital  and  deducting  therefrom  (i)  the  assessed  value  of  real  estate  as  provided  in  §  58.1-1206,  (ii)  the  book  value  of  tangible  personal  property  under  §  58.1-1206,  (iii)  the  pro  rata  share  of  government  obligations  as  set  forth  in  § 58.1-1206, (iv) the capital accounts of any bank subsidiaries  under  §  58.1-1206,  (v)  the  amount  of  any  reserve  for  marketable securities valuation which is included in capital, surplus  and  undivided  profits  as  defined  hereinabove  to  the  extent  that  such  reserve  reflects  the  difference  between  the  book  value  and  the  market  value  of  such  marketable  securities on December 31 next preceding the date for filing the  bank’s  return  under  §  58.1-1207,  and  (vi)  the  value  of  goodwill described under subdivision A 5 of § 58.1-1206.

Cities  (§  58.1-1208),  counties  (§  58.1-1210),  and  incorporated towns (§ 58.1-1209) are permitted to charge an  additional  franchise  tax  of  80  percent  of  the  state  rate  of  taxation.  If  a  locality  imposes  the  local  tax,  then  a  bank  is  entitled  to  a  credit  against  the  state  franchise  tax  equal  to  the  total  amount  of  local  franchise  tax  paid  (§ 58.1-1213). All localities that impose the bank franchise tax do so at the maximum rate allowed by statute. 

If a bank has branches in more than one taxable subdivision (that is, city, county, or incorporated town), the tax imposed by the subdivision must be in the proportion of the taxable value of the net capital based on the total deposits of the bank or banks located inside the taxing subdivision to the total deposits in Virginia of the bank as of the end of the preceding year (§ 58.1-1211).

The survey asked whether a locality levied a bank tax. Of those localities that answered, all cities, 85 counties, and 108 towns answered affirmatively. The number of counties responding positively contrasts with the number of counties that reported receiving money from the tax in the Auditor of Public Accounts’ Comparative Report. The reported disparity may be because a number of counties answered positively for having the tax when they actually only processed forms for  towns  having  the  tax.  A  list  of  localities  that  reported  imposing the tax can be found in **Table 19.1**.

## COMMUNICATIONS SALES AND USE TAX
In  2006,  legislation  enacted  by  the  General  Assembly,  House Bill 568, replaced many state and local taxes and fees on communications services with a flat 5 percent rate. The tax is collected from consumers by their service providers and is then remitted to the Virginia Department of Taxation. The department then distributes the monies to the localities on a percentage basis derived from their participation in the local taxes which the new fl at tax superseded. The communication sales and use tax is a state tax not a local tax. Beginning in FY 2010 the Auditor of Public Accounts reported the proceeds as part of noncategorical state aid to localities.

The communications sales and use tax replaced a variety of local taxes: the consumer utility tax on land line and wireless telephone service, the local E-911 tax on land line telephone service, a portion of the BPOL tax assessed on public service companies by certain localities that impose the  tax  at  a  rate  higher  than  0.5  percent,  the  local  video  programming  excise  tax  on  cable  television  services,  and  the local consumer utility tax on cable television service. 

The communications sales and use tax does not affect several related taxes: the state E-911 fee on wireless telephone service; the public rights-of-way use fee on land line telephone service; and the local tax of 0.5 percent on public service companies (also called the utility license tax).

**Table  19.2**  presents  a  listing  of  the  localities  that  received distributions from the communications sales and use tax in fiscal year 2018. The information was taken from Table 5.6 of the Virginia Department of Taxation’s Annual Report, Fiscal Year 2018, the latest year available.

## SHORT-TERM DAILY RENTAL TAX
In 2010 the General Assembly modified short-term rental property classifications. Short-term rental property can once again be included in merchants’ capital as a separate classification.  Consequently,  localities  may  tax  this  property  either  as  merchants’  capital  or  short-term  rental  property, but not as both. Whether considered under the merchants’ capital  tax  or  the  short-term  property  tax,  the  category  of  property shall not be considered tangible personal property for purposes of taxation.

The new law maintains the usual exclusions. Therefore, the  category  of  short-term  rental  property  still  excludes  “(i) trailers as defined in § 46.2-100, and (ii) other tangible personal property required to be licensed or registered with the  Department  of  Motor  Vehicles,  Department  of  Game  and  Inland  Fisheries,  or  Department  of  Aviation  (§  58.1-3510.4).”  The  most  important  exception  listed  is  motor  vehicles for rent. These fall under the merchants’ capital tax as a separate classification, discussed in Section 8.

For  purposes  of  taxation  under  the  short-term  rental  tax, property is classified into two types: short-term rental property  and  heavy  equipment  short-term  rental  property  (§ 58.1-3510.6). Short-term rental property may be taxed at 1  percent  of  gross  receipts.  Heavy  equipment  short-term  rental  property  may  be  taxed  up  to  1.5  percent  of  gross  receipts. **Table 19.3** lists the 20 cities, 19 counties, and 2 towns that reported having the short-term rental tax.
