<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Local License Tax on Mobile Food Units</h3>
<p>Senate Bill 1425 (Chapter 791) provides that when the owner of a new business that operates a mobile food unit has paid a license tax as required by the locality in which the mobile food unit is registered, the owner is not required to pay a license tax to any other locality for conducting business from such mobile food unit in such a locality.<span class="math inline">\(^1\)</span></p>
<p>This exemption from paying the license tax in other localities expires two years after the payment of the initial license tax in the locality in which the mobile food unit is registered. During the two year exemption period, the owner is entitled to exempt up to three mobile food units from license taxation in other localities. However, the owner of the mobile food unit is required to register with the Commissioner of the Revenue or Director of Finance in any locality in which he conducts business from such mobile food unit, regardless of whether the owner is exempt from paying license tax in the locality.</p>
<p>This Act defines “mobile food unit” as a restaurant that is mounted on wheels and readily moveable from place to place at all times during operation. It also defines “new business” as a business that locates for the first time to do business in a locality. A business will not be deemed a new business based on a merger, acquisition, similar business combination, name change, or a change to its business form.</p>
<p>Without the exemption provided in this Act, localities are authorized to impose business, professional and occupational license (BPOL) taxes upon local businesses. Generally, the BPOL tax is levied on the privilege of engaging in business at a definite place of business within a Virginia locality. Businesses that are mobile, however, can be subject to license taxes or fees in multiple localities in certain situations.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Local Gas Road Improvement Tax; Extension of Sunset Provision</h3>
<p>House Bill 2555 (Chapter 24) and Senate Bill 1165 (Chapter 191) extend the sunset date for the local gas road improve-ment tax from January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2022. The authority to impose the local gas road improvement tax was previously scheduled to sunset on January 1, 2020.</p>
<p>The localities that comprise the Virginia Coalfield Economic Development Authority may impose a local gas road improvement tax that is capped at a rate of one percent of the gross receipts from the sale of gases severed within the locality. Under current law, the revenues generated from this tax are allocated as follows: 75% are paid into a special fund in each locality called the Coal and Gas Road Improvement Fund, where at least 50% are spent on road improvements and 25% may be spent on new water and sewer systems or the construction, repair, or enhancement of natural gas systems and lines within the locality; and the remaining 25% of the revenue is paid to the Virginia Coal-fi eld Economic Development Fund. The Virginia Coalfi eld Economic Development Authority is comprised of the City of Norton, and the Counties of Buchanan, Dickenson, Lee, Russell, Scott, Tazewell, and Wise.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Real Property Tax Exemptions for Elderly and Disabled: Computation of Income Limitation</h3>
<p>House Bill 1937 (Chapter 16) provides that, if a locality has established a real estate tax exemption for the elderly and handicapped and enacted an income limitation related to the exemption, it may exclude, for purposes of calculating the income limitation, any disability income received by a family member or nonrelative who lives in the dwelling and who is permanently and totally disabled.</p>
<p>Under current law, if a locality’s tax relief ordinance establishes an annual income limitation, the computation of annual income is calculated by adding together the income received during the preceding calendar year of the owners of the dwelling who use it as their principal residence; and the owners’ relatives who live in the dwelling, except for those relatives living in the dwelling and providing bona fide caregiving services to the owner whether such relatives are compensated or not; and at the option of each locality, nonrelatives of the owner who live in the dwelling except for bona fide tenants or bona fide caregivers of the owner, whether compensated or not.</p>

<p>House Bill 2150 (Chapter 736) and Senate Bill 1196 (Chapter 737) clarify the definition of “dwelling,” for purposes of the real property tax exemption for owners who are 65 years of age or older or permanently and totally disabled, to include certain improvements to the exempt land and the land on which the improvements are situated. These Acts define the term “dwelling” to include an improvement to the land that is not used for a business purpose but is used to house certain motor vehicles or household goods.</p>
<p>Under current law, in order to be granted real property tax relief, qualifying property must be owned by and occupied as the sole dwelling of a person who is at least 65 years of age, or, if the local ordinance provides, any person with a permanent disability. Dwellings jointly held by spouses, with no other joint owners, qualify if either spouse is 65 or over or permanently and totally disabled.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Real Property Tax: Partial Exemption from Real Property Taxes for Flood Mitigation Efforts</h3>
<p>Senate Bill 1588 (Chapter 754) enables a locality to provide by ordinance a partial exemption from real property taxes for flooding abatement, mitigation, or resiliency efforts for improved real estate that is subject to recurrent flooding, as authorized by an amendment to Article X, Section 6 of the Constitution of Virginia that was adopted by the voters on November 6, 2018.</p>
<p>This act provides that exemptions may only be granted for qualifying flood improvements that do not increase the size of any impervious area and are made to qualifying structures or to land. “Qualifying structures” are defined as structures that were completed prior to July 1, 2018 or were completed more than 10 years prior to the completion of the improvements. For improvements made to land, the improvements must be made primarily for the benefit of one or more qualifying structures. No exemption will be authorized for any improvements made prior to July 1, 2018.</p>
<p>A locality is granted the authority to (i) establish flood protection standards that qualifying flood improvements must meet in order to be eligible for the exemption; (ii) determine the amount of the exemption; (iii) set income or property value limitations on eligibility; (iv) provide that the exemption shall only last for a certain number of years; (v) determine, based upon flood risk, areas of the locality where the exemption may be claimed; and (vi) establish preferred actions for qualifying for the exemption, including living shorelines.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Personal Property Tax Exemption for Agricultural Vehicles</h3>
<p>House Bill 2733 (Chapter 259) expands the definition of agricultural use motor vehicles for personal property taxation purposes. It changes the criteria from motor vehicles used “exclusively” for agricultural purposes to motor vehicles used “primarily” for agricultural purposes, and for which the owner is not required to obtain a registration certificate, license plate, and decal or pay a registration fee.</p>
<p>It also expands the definition of trucks or tractor trucks that are used by farmers in their farming operations for the transportation of farm animals or other farm products or for the transport of farm-related machinery. The criteria is changed from vehicles used “exclusively” by farmers in their farming operations to vehicles used “primarily” by farmers in their farming operations.</p>
<p>Further, this Act expands the classifi cation of farm machinery and equipment that a local governing body may exempt, to include equipment and machinery used by a nursery for the production of horticultural products, and any farm tractor, regardless of whether such farm tractor is used exclusively for agricultural purposes.</p>
<p>Local governing bodies have the option to exempt these classifi cations, in whole or in part, from taxation or to provide for a different rate of taxation thereon.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3</span> Intangible Personal Property Tax: Classifi cation of Certain Business Property</h3>
<p>House Bill 2440 (Chapter 255) classifies as intangible per-sonal property, tangible personal property: i) that is used in a trade or business; ii) with an original cost of less than $25; and iii) that is not classified as machinery and tools, merchants’ capital, or short-term rental property. It also exempts such property from taxation.</p>
<p>Intangible personal property is a separate class of prop-erty segregated for taxation by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth does not currently tax intangible personal property. Localities are prohibited from taxing intangible personal property.</p>
<p>Certain personal property, while tangible in fact, has previously been designated as intangible and thus exempted from state and local taxation. For example, tangible personal property used in manufacturing, mining, water well drill-ing, radio or television broadcasting, dairy, dry cleaning, or laundry businesses has been designated as exempt intangible personal property.</p>
