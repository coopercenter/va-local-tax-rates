# Meals, Transient Occupancy, Cigarettes, Tobacco, and Admissions Excise Taxes

Among the many local taxes levied by Virginia’s localities are four excise taxes on meals, transient occupancy, cigarettes and admissions. **Table 16.1** provides a detailed list of rates for these taxes for the 38 cities, 82 counties, and 108 towns reporting at least one of these taxes.

## MEALS TAX
|   The meals tax is a flat percentage imposed on the price of a meal. In fiscal year 2018, the most recent year available from the Auditor of Public Accounts, the tax accounted for 7.5 percent of the total tax revenue for cities, 1.2 percent for counties, and 23.5 percent for large towns. The low percentage for counties is explained by the fact that slightly less than one-half of the counties employ the tax and those that have it cannot exceed a rate of 4 percent, whereas cities and towns are allowed to impose a higher tax rate. The authority to levy this tax varies greatly among jurisdictions, so the tax varies significantly among individual cities, counties, and towns. For information on tax receipts of individual localities, see Appendix C.
|
|   Counties  are  restricted  in  their  authority  to  levy  the  meals tax within the limits of an incorporated town unless the town grants the county authority to do so (§ 58.1-3711). Cities and towns are granted the authority to levy the tax under the “general taxing powers” found in their charters (§ 58.1-3840). 
|
|   Counties may levy a meals tax on food and beverages offered for human consumption if the tax is approved in a voter referendum (§ 58.1-3833). However, several counties have been exempted from the voter referendum requirement [see  §  58.1-3833  (B)  of  the  Code  of  Virginia].  Cities  and  towns do not need to have a referendum when deciding to impose the tax. 
|
|   There are certain restrictions in applying the meals tax. The tax cannot be imposed on food that meets the definition of food under the Federal Food Stamp Program, with the exception  of  sandwiches,  salad  bar  items,  certain  prepackaged  salads, and non-factory sealed beverages. It does not apply to certain volunteer and non-profit organizations that might sell food on an occasional basis nor does it apply to churches and  their  members.  Also,  the  meals  tax  cannot  exceed  4  percent in counties. Cities and towns may exceed that rate. Accordingly,  34  cities  and  78  towns  report  charging  a  meals  tax  over  4  percent.  In  addition,  the  meals  tax  does not apply to gratuities, whether or not a restaurant makes them mandatory.
|
|   The first  column  of  **Table  16.1**  lists  the  rates  for  the  meals  tax.  All  cities  impose  a  meals  tax.  The  median  tax  rate is 6 percent. The minimum rate, charged by four cities, is 4 percent, and the maximum, charged by Covington is 8 percent. The median meals tax rate is lower among the 50 counties that report having it. All counties that report having the meal tax have a rate of 4 percent. Among the 105 towns that report having a meals tax, the minimum rate is 2 percent, the maximum 8 percent, and the median rate is 5 percent.

|
|   The local meals tax is in addition to the state 4.3 percent sales tax (5 percent in localities constituting transportation districts in northern Virginia and Hampton Roads) and the 1 percent local option sales tax (see § 58.1-603). This means that the combined state and local tax rate on restaurant meals could be anywhere in the range of 7 to 14 percent for cities, counties, and towns that impose this tax. Such rates apply to all restaurant meals whether consumed at elegant dining establishments or fast food providers. 
|
## TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX
|   The transient occupancy tax (lodging tax) is a flat percentage imposed on the charge for the occupancy of any room or  space  in  hotels,  motels,  boarding  houses,  travel  camp-grounds, and other facilities providing lodging for less than thirty days. The tax applies to rooms intended or suitable for dwelling and sleeping. Therefore, the tax does not apply to rooms used for alternative purposes, such as banquet rooms and meeting rooms. 
|
|   In fiscal  year  2018,  the  occupancy  tax  accounted  for  2.2 percent of the total tax revenue for cities, 0.9 percent for counties, and 5.6 percent for large towns. These are averages; the relative importance of the tax varies significantly among individual cities, counties, and towns. For information on tax receipts of individual localities, see Appendix C.
|
|   According  to  §  58.1-3819,  counties  may  levy  a  transient occupancy tax with a maximum tax rate of 2 percent. Counties  specified  in  §  58.1-3819(A)  may  increase  their  transient  occupancy  tax  to  a  maximum  of  5  percent.  The  portion of the tax collections exceeding 2 percent must be used by the county for tourism and tourism related expenses. According to § 58.1-3819, the following counties are permitted  to  levy  the  5  percent  rate:  Accomack,  Albemarle,  Alleghany, Amherst, Arlington, Augusta, Bedford, Bland, Botetourt, Brunswick, Campbell, Caroline, Carroll, Craig, Cumberland,  Dickenson,  Dinwiddie,  Floyd,  Franklin,  Frederick, Giles, Gloucester, Goochland, Grayson, Greene, Greensville, Halifax, Highland, Isle of Wight, James City, King  George,  Loudoun,  Madison,  Mecklenburg,  Montgomery,  Nelson,  Northampton,  Page,  Patrick,  Powhatan,  Prince  Edward,  Prince  George,  Prince  William,  Pulaski,  Rockbridge,  Rockingham,  Russell,  Smyth,  Spotsylvania,  Stafford,  Tazewell,  Warren,  Washington,  Wise,  Wythe,  and York.
|
|   Certain  counties  are  permitted  to  levy  higher  rates.  Roanoke  County  was  given  permission  to  levy  a  rate  of  7  percent in 2012, with a portion of the revenue going to tourism  advertisement.  James  City  and  York  counties  have  5  percent rates but are also allowed to charge an additional $2 per room per night. The proceeds of these additional taxes go to  tourism  advertising  (§  58.1-3823(C)).  Certain  cities  and  towns also charge specific dollar amounts in addition to the percent rates; they are the cities of Alexandria, Lynchburg, Newport News, and Norfolk and the town of Dumfries. It is assumed, but not verified, that these policies are permitted by the localities’ charters.
|
|   In 2018 the General Assembly authorized the replacement of a regional transient occupancy tax in the Northern Virginia Transportation District with a 2 percent transient occupancy tax to fund transportation in that area. This tax includes the counties of Arlington, Fairfax, and Loudoun, and the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, and Falls Church. In addition, the assembly funded a 2 percent local transportation  transient  occupancy  tax  for  the  localities  of  Prince  William County and Manassas City and Manassas Park City. 
|
|   Counties  are  restricted  in  their  authority  to  levy  the  lodging tax within the limits of an incorporated town unless the town grants the county authority to do so (§ 58.1-3711). Cities and towns are granted the authority to levy the lodging taxes under the “general taxing powers” found in their charters (§ 58.1-3840).
|
|   The median rate for the 37 cities that report using the transient occupancy tax is 8 percent, the minimum 2 percent, and the maximum is 11 percent (Emporia). Seventy-nine counties report imposing a transient occupancy tax. The extremes range from 2 to 8 percent with a median rate of 5 percent. The 77 towns that report having the tax show a median of 5 percent with a minimum rate of 1 percent and a maximum of 9 percent. The following text table summarizes the dispersion of the transient occupancy tax among cities, counties, and towns:

|
|   The local transient occupancy tax is in addition to the state 4.3 percent sales tax (5 percent in localities constituting transportation districts in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads) and the 1 percent local option sales tax. This means that  the  combined  state  and  local  tax  rate  for  hotel-motel  stays can be very high. In a special district of Virginia Beach the  combined  rate  is  16.5  percent  (10.5  percent  transient  occupancy tax, 1 percent local option sales and use tax, and 5 percent state sales and use tax applicable for localities in Hampton Roads).
|
## CIGARETTE AND TOBACCO TAXES
|   In fiscal year 2018, cigarette and tobacco taxes accounted for 0.9 percent of the total tax revenue collected by cities, 0.1 percent   of that collected by counties, and  2.1 percent of that collected by large towns. The very low percentage for counties is attributable to the fact that few counties levy cigarette and tobacco taxes. These  are  averages;  the  relative  importance  of  the  tax  varies  significantly among individual cities and towns. For information on individual localities, see Appendix C.
|
|   The  state  is  authorized  by  §  58.1-1001  of  the  Code  to  impose  an  excise  tax  of  1.5  cents  on  each  cigarette  sold  or  stored  (30  cents  on  a  pack  of  20).  Section  58.1-3830  allows for the local taxation of the sale or use of cigarettes. Cities  and  towns  are  granted  the  authority  to  levy  the  tax  under  the  “general  taxing  powers”  found  in  their  charters  (§ 58.1-3840). The right to levy the tax has been granted to only two counties by general law. Fairfax and Arlington counties may levy the cigarette tax with a maximum rate of 5 cents per pack or the amount levied under state law, whichever is greater  (§  58.1-3831).  The  two  counties  have  followed  the  state’s example and raised their taxes to 30 cents for a pack of  20. No county cigarette tax is applicable within town limits if the town’s governing body does not authorize that county to levy the tax. This restriction applies to  towns in Fairfax County, including Herndon, Vienna, and Occoquan.
|
|   Unlike the meals and transient occupancy taxes, which are added directly to the bill at the time of purchase, the cigarette tax is added onto the price per pack before the purchaser buys the cigarettes. The tobacco tax is levied either as a flat tax or as a portion of gross receipts. If no schedule is given in **Table 16.1**, then it should be read as a flat tax. A total of 31 cities levy some sort of tax on cigarettes, while 2 counties and 66 towns report doing so. The following text table, based on the tax of a pack of 20 cigarettes, summarizes the dispersion of cigarette taxes among cities, counties and towns.

|
|   The cigarette tax is in addition to the state 4.3 percent sales tax (5 percent in localities constituting transportation districts in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads) and the 1 percent local option sales tax.
|
## ADMISSIONS TAX
|   In fiscal  year  2018,  the  admissions  tax  accounted  for  0.4  percent  of  the  total  tax  revenue  for  cities.  Receipts  were  negligible  for  counties  and  large  towns.  These  are  averages; the relative importance of the tax varies significantly among individual localities. For information on receipts by individual localities, see Appendix C.
|
|   Events to which admissions are charged are classified into five groups by § 58.1-3817 of the *Code of Virginia*; they are: (1) those events from which the gross receipts go entirely to  charitable  purposes;  (2)  admissions  charged  for  events sponsored  by  public  and  private  educational  institutions;  (3) admissions charged for entry into museums, botanical or similar gardens and zoos; (4) admissions charged for sporting events; and (5) all other admissions. 
|
|   In  imposing  the  admissions  tax,  localities  have  the  authority to tax each class of admissions with the same or with a different tax rate. A locality may impose admission taxes  at  lower  rates  for  events  held  in  privately-owned  facilities  than  for  events  held  in  facilities  owned  by  the  locality. Section 58.1-3818 allows a locality to exempt certain qualified charitable events from admissions tax charges. Fifteen counties (Arlington, Brunswick, Charlotte, Clarke,  Culpeper, Dinwiddie, Fairfax, Madison, Nelson, New Kent, Prince  George,  Scott,  Stafford,  Sussex,  and  Washington)  have  been  granted  permission  to  levy  an  admissions  tax  at a rate not to exceed 10 percent of the amount of charge for  admissions  (§§  58.1-3818  and  58.1-3840).  Only  three  counties,  Dinwiddie,  Roanoke,  and  Washington,  report  levying the tax.
|
|   Cities and towns are granted the authority to levy the admissions tax under the “general taxing powers” found in their charters (§ 58.1-3840). As shown in the text table, 18 cities  and  3  towns  (Cape  Charles,  Culpeper,  and  Vinton)  reported  levying  the  admissions  tax.  For  cities,  the  levy  ranged  from  5  percent  to  the  full  10  percent.  The  median  rate was 7 percent.
