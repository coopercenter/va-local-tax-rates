<h1><span class="header-section-number">Section 2</span> Real Property Tax in 2019</h1>
<p>The real property tax is by far the most important source of tax revenue for localities. In fiscal year 2018, the most recent year available from the Auditor of Public Accounts, it accounted for 55.5 percent of tax revenue for cities, 64.6 percent for counties, and 29.1 percent for large towns. These are averages; the relative importance of taxes in individual cities, counties, and towns varies significantly. For information on individual localities, see Appendix C.
The <em>Code of Virginia</em>, §§ 58.1-3200 through 58.1-3389, authorizes localities to levy taxes on real property (land, including the buildings and improvements on it). There is no restriction on the tax rate that may be imposed. Section 58.1-3201 provides that all general reassessments or annual assessments shall be at 100 percent of fair market value.</p>
<div id="public-service-corporations" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> PUBLIC SERVICE CORPORATIONS</h2>
<p>Property owned by so-called public service corporations is not assessed by localities. Instead, that task is delegated to the State Corporation Commission (SCC) and the Department of Taxation.The State Corporation Commission assesses electric utilities and cooperatives, gas pipeline distribution companies, public service water companies, and telephone and telegraph companies. The Department of Taxation assesses pipeline transmission companies and railroads.</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2018, the property tax on public service corporations accounted for 1.7 percent of tax revenue for
cities, 2.6 percent for counties, and 0.8 percent for large towns. These are averages; the relative importance of the tax
in individual cities, counties, and towns varies significantly. In two counties with large power generating facilities the
property tax on public service corporations accounts for a very large share of local tax revenue. In Bath County the share was 47.6 percent and in Surry County the share was 61.1 percent. For more information on individual localities, see Appendix C.</p>
<p>The commissioner of the revenue or another designated official in each city or county is required to provide by
January 1 of each year to any public service company with property in its area a copy of the property boundaries of
the locality in which any part of the company is located (§ 58.1-2601). The State Corporation Commission or the
Department of Taxation send out their assessments for the property based on these boundaries (§ 58.1-2602). Localities examine the assessments to determine their correctness. If correct, the locality determines the equalized assessed valuation of the corporate property by applying the local assessment ratio prevailing in the locality for other real estate (§ 58.1-2604). Local taxes are then assigned to real and tangible personal property at the real property tax rate current in the locality (§ 58.1-2606).</p>
</div>
<div id="tax-relief-programs" class="section level2" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> TAX RELIEF PROGRAMS</h2>
<p>There are several types of locally financed tax relief programs available. Section 3 of this study contains information on so-called circuit breaker plans for the elderly and disabled. Section 4 covers land use assessments for agricultural, horticultural, forestal, and open space real estate. Section 5 contains information on preferential assessments for
agricultural and forestal districts. Finally, Section 6 covers property tax exemptions for certain rehabilitated real estate and other exemptions.</p>
<p>Only the city of Charlottesville, Loudoun County, and Arlington County reported providing tax relief for low-income
owners and renters who are not elderly. The city of Charlottesville administers the Charlottesville Housing Affordability Program (CHAP) to help low and middle income homeowners. The program awards grants up to $1,000 to homeowners with houses assessed at less than $375,000 and having an annual income less than <span class="math inline">\(55,000.\)</span>^1$ Loudoun County administers the Affordable Dwelling Unit Program for renters and first-time buyers. Buyers need an income greater than 30 percent but less than 70 percent of the area median income to participate. Qualified renters are eligible to rent apartments at rates from $630 to $1,300. Arlington County’s Housing Grants Program is available to working families with at least one child under age 18. Personal assets may not exceed $35,000 and there is an income limit based on household size.</p>
<p>Localities are permitted to institute deferral for a portion of the real estate tax by § 58.1-3219 of the <em>Code of Virginia</em>. Localities are permitted to grant deferrals from the full amount by which each taxpayer’s real estate tax levy exceeds 105 percent of the previous year’s tax, or such higher percentage adopted by the locality. Deferred taxes are subject to interest in an amount established by the governing body, not to exceed the rate published by the IRS code.<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> The deferral potentially applies to every property owner, not just the elderly and disabled. (For deferrals limited to the elderly and disabled see Section 3 of this study.)</p>
<p>The deferral program is rarely used. Administrative problems appear to be the major reason for the unpopularity of deferral programs. Loudoun County had a deferral program in place in the 1990s but terminated it “… because the program was administratively complex, cumbersome and required staff time in disproportion to the benefit received by the taxpayer.”<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> The cities of Alexandria, Falls Church, and Fairfax and the counties of Fairfax and Henrico considered deferral but
did not adopt it. According to Henrico staff, “The administrative procedures for tracing the properties and recovering the
relevant taxes upon either the death of the owner or transfer of the property itself would be both cumbersome and time consuming and could not be accomplished with existing staffing levels or existing computer systems.”<span class="math inline">\(^4\)</span> Another reason for the unpopularity of the programs may be that taxpayers only receive postponement, not removal, of the tax liability. The cities of Charlottesville and Richmond, the county of Middlesex, and the town of Amherst were the only localities reporting a deferral program in 2019.</p>

<div id="statutory-rates-special-taxes-due-dates-proration-and-billing-practices" class="section level2" number="2.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> STATUTORY RATES, SPECIAL TAXES, DUE DATES, PRORATION, AND BILLING PRACTICES</h2>
<p><strong>Table 2.1</strong> provides general information associated with real property taxes in Virginia’s localities. The table provides
an estimate by locality of both the number of total taxable real estate parcels and the number of residential parcels.
Twenty-seven cities, 80 counties and 52 towns provided estimates of one or both types of parcels. The total number of parcels in cities ranged from a high of 158,431 (Virginia Beach) down to 2,456 (Lexington). Among counties, the number of parcels ranged from a high of 354,687 (Fairfax) down to 3,940 (Highland).</p>
<p>Table 2.1 also lists the statutory (nominal) tax rates. The statutory rate is the rate used by localities and is applied to the assessed value of a property. In the table, statutory rates are listed under calendar year (CY) or fiscal year (FY) columns depending on the locality’s assessment cycle. In most cases the calendar year tax rate listed runs from January 1 to December 31 and the fiscal year rate runs from July 1 to June 30. The provisions explaining the assessment cycle requirements are found in § 58.1-3010 and § 58.1-3011 of the <em>Code of Virginia</em>. However, some localities report a calendar year assessment schedule with a fiscal year valuation. Six cities (Chesapeake, Harrisonburg, Martinsville, Roanoke, Salem, and Suffolk) and one county (James City) report this practice. Otherwise, 15 cities and 88 counties reported using the calendar year cycle while 176 cities and 6 counties used fiscal year assessment cycles.</p>
<p>The statutory tax rates were reported to the Cooper Center by all cities and counties and 112 of the responding towns. The text table below lists the averages for the statutory rates from the localities.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="real-property-tax-in-2019.html#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#table name: Statutory Real Estate Tax Rates per $100 of Assessed Taxable Value for Localities Reporting, CY 2019 and FY 2020</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Statutory rates are generally higher for cities than counties. The rates are lowest in towns because they are subordinate to counties and have limited responsibilities.</p>
<p>Tax due dates vary among localities. Generally, if taxes are paid annually, they are due by December 5. If paid semiannually, they are due by June 5 and December 5. However, some localities have different due dates, as provided by § 58.1-3916 of the <em>Code</em>.</p>
<p>Most cities have semiannual tax due dates with payments required in June and December. Of the 38 cities, 2 required taxes due annually, 31 semiannually, and 5 quarterly. Among the counties, 32 had annual tax due dates, while 63 had semiannual requirements. Of the towns responding to this question, 80 reported annual due dates, and 32 required semiannual payments.</p>
<p>A locality is permitted to prorate the taxable amount. Any county, city, or town electing to prorate new buildings which are substantially complete prior to November 1 must do so at the time the building is complete or fit to live in. Of the 38 cities, 33 reported prorating taxes while 5 reported not doing so. Among counties, 67 prorated their taxes while 28 did not. Reports from the towns that answered this question indicated that 47 prorated their taxes while 652 did not.</p>
<p>The final column of Table 2.1 pertains to town billing practices. Three possibilities exist: (1) a town sends out its own bills and collects its taxes (TT in the table), (2) a town collects its taxes but the county sends the bills (CT in the
table), or (3) a town has the county bill and collect the taxes (CC in the table). Of the towns that answered the question,
the overwhelming majority, 100, reported billing and collecting their own taxes. Four said they collected taxes, while in three the county both billed and collected town taxes.</p>
<p><strong>Table 2.2, Table 2.3,</strong> and <strong>Table 2.4</strong> provide additional information concerning statutory real property tax rates. The <em>Code</em> allows localities to add special purpose levies on top of the real property rate for various purposes. Table 2.2 deals with the category of special districts. A special district is organized to perform a single governmental function or a restricted number of related functions. Special districts usually have the power to incur debt and levy taxes to fund special activities such as capital improvements, emergency services, sewer and water services, or pest control within those districts. Thirteen cities, 14 counties, and 4 towns reported levying these taxes. The table includes the base (statutory) rate for the locality, the district in which the activity takes place, the purpose of the activity, and the special rate imposed for that activity. Most special activity taxes are in addition to the base rate, though some are simply a flat fee, and others are a percentage rate based on improvements to the property.</p>
<p>Another special district category is the community development authority (CDA). Such an authority is a district created by the locality based on a petition from the property owners to help develop and maintain desired public infrastructure improvements, such as roads and buildings. The CDA is usually associated with development interests, such as retail centers, industrial centers, or tourism centers. Generally the CDA pays for development by issuing bonds and then having the property owners pay special assessments based on the level of debt. Assessments are levied either by placing a tax, such as $0.25 per $100 of assessed value, on the property within the district or by a special assessment each year that determines the benefit from the improvements and allocates them by property value. Depending on how the bond agreement is structured, assessment payments may be made directly to bondholders or to the locality. Table 2.3 lists community development authorities by locality. The table includes the name of the project, the purpose, the size, the bond amount, and, where possible, the current value. Three cities and 8 counties reported having CDAs.</p>
<p>The final category of special districts is that of localities within the Northern Virginia Transportation Authority. Localities within this authority have the ability to tax real property associated with industrial and commercial use up
to $0.125 per $100 of assessed value to help fund transportation improvements. In 2009, an amendment to § 58.1-3221.3 specified that the revenues generated by the tax were to be used solely for (1) new road construction, design, and right-of-way acquisition, (2) new public transit construction, design, and right-of-way acquisition, (3) capital costs related to new transportation projects, or (4) the issuance costs and debt service on any bonds issued to support capital costs. There are 11 localities in the region of the authority: the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, Falls Church, Fredericksburg, Manassas, and Manassas Park and the counties of Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, Prince William, and Stafford. Of those, one city (Fairfax) and two counties (Arlington and Fairfax) reported implementing the tax, as shown in Table 2.4.</p>
</div>
<div id="assessment-practices-reassessments-assessed-values" class="section level2" number="2.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> ASSESSMENT PRACTICES, REASSESSMENTS, ASSESSED VALUES</h2>
<p><strong>Table 2.5</strong> details assessment practices among localities. The table includes cities and counties, but not towns, because only a small percentage of towns provided substantive answers. For those interested in the towns that responded, data are available from the Cooper Center upon request.</p>
<p>The second column lists whether a locality has a full-time assessor. Twenty-seven cities reported employing a full-time property tax assessor, while 11 did not. In contrast, only 36 counties had a full-time assessor while 59 did not. This reflects the fact that many counties reassess property less frequently than cities. No towns had assessors, since towns rely on assessed values established by their host counties.</p>
<p>Columns three, four, five, and six of Table 2.5 provide data on the conduct of general reassessments and cover four questions. (1) Are reassessments done by the locality or contracted out? (2) What is the reassessment frequency? (3) Is physical inspection part of the reassessment? (4) When was the reassessment last done? Regarding the conduct of the general reassessment, 28 cities reported conducting reassessments in-house while 10 reported contracting with outside assessors. Twenty-eight counties reported doing general reassessments in-house, while 67 reported contracting out for services. Section 58.1-3250 of the <em>Code</em> requires cities to have a general reassessment of real estate every two years. However, any city with a total population of 30,000 or less may elect to conduct its general reassessments at four-year intervals.<span class="math inline">\(^5\)</span> Counties are required to have a general reassessment every four years (§ 58.1-3252). There is an exception for counties with a total population of 50,000 or less. These counties may elect to reassess at either five-year or six-year intervals (§ 58.1-3252). However, nothing in these sections affects the power of cities and counties to reassess more frequently. A large majority of the cities (30) reassess at one or two year intervals. In contrast, less than three out of ten counties (27) reassess that frequently. Virtually all of the populous cities and counties reassess annually or biennially. Towns rely on their surrounding county to provide assessments, so a town’s reassessment occurs with the same frequency as the county’s. The reassessment periods are summarized in the table on the following page.</p>
<p>Column seven of Table 2.5 shows information about maintenance assessments. While general reassessments involve reassessing all parcels to reflect changes in market value, maintenance assessments involve adjusting assessed values between reassessments because of new construction, improvements, damages, demolitions, subdivisions, and consolidations. Thirty-three cities responded that they performed maintenance assessments using staff, while five reported contracting for the work. Among counties, 66 reported performing maintenance reassessments using staff, while 29 reported contracting the work to independent appraisers.</p>
<p>Columns eight and nine of Table 2.5 cover physical inspection. Physical inspection refers to the actual inspection of the property as opposed to computerized mass-appraisal of parcels. If a locality responded that it did not perform physical inspections during the general reassessment, two further questions were asked:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="real-property-tax-in-2019.html#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#table name: Reassessment Periods for Real Estate, 2019</span></span></code></pre></div>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Does the locality perform a physical inspection at all? (2) If so, what is the inspection cycle? Among cities that responded, 18 reportedly did not have a physical inspection separate from the general reassessment cycle. Twenty others reported having a physical inspection cycle, the periods ranging anywhere from two to six years. Among counties that responded, 70 indicated they performed physical inspections during general reassessment, while 25 reported having physical inspection cycles ranging anywhere from one to six years.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Table 2.6</strong> provides unpublished Department of Taxation 2018 data on total taxable assessed value of real estate by category. Taxable assessed value shows property qualifying for use value at its use value, not its market value. The percentage distribution of taxable assessed value is shown for two types of residential property (single-family and multi-family) as well as commercial and industrial property and agricultural property.</p>
<p>The text table on the next page compares the taxable assessed value by category for cities and counties. The total assessed value for all cities amounted to $277.4 billion. Single-family residential property averaged 64.9 percent of taxable assessed value. Multi-family residential property averaged 11.1 percent of taxable assessed value. Commercial/industrial properties averaged just over one-quarter of the total value at 23.9 percent, while agricultural property values amounted to only 0.1 percent.</p>
<p>The total assessed value of property by category for counties in 2018 amounted to $854.5 billion. Of that amount, 72.0 percent of assessed value was associated with single-family residential property, 5.9 percent with multi-family residential property, 18.2 percent with commercial/industrial property, and 4.0 percent with agricultural property.</p>
<p>With the total amounts from cities and counties combined, the total assessed valuation amounted to $1,131.9 billion. Of that, 70.2 percent applied to single-family residential property, 7.1 percent applied to multi-family residential property, 19.6 percent applied to commercial/industrial property, and 3.0 percent to agricultural property.</p>
<p>Looking at the percentage breakdown for each type of locality, in 2018 the share of taxable</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="real-property-tax-in-2019.html#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#table name: Taxable Assessed Value by Category for Cities and Counties, 2018</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>assessed value for cities in the single-family residential category was between 40 percent and 59.9 percent in 19 cities and 60 percent or more in 18 cities. All cities but two had multi-family residential values under 19.9 percent of the total assessed value. Commercial and industrial property was the second most common category with 21 of the cities having between 20 percent and 39.9 percent of their property valuations coming from this type of property. Finally, only the cities of Suffolk and Franklin had more than 2 percent of their property valuation associated with agriculture.</p>
<p>Among counties the breakdown was slightly different. As in cities, the single-family residential value dominated the percentage breakdown. The single-family residential assessment percentage amounted to 60 percent or more for 71 counties. Another 20 received between 40 percent and 59.9 percent of the valuation from single-family residential real estate, while in four counties residential valuations amounted to no more than 39.9 percent of the total taxable assessed value (Buchanan, Dickenson, Highland, and Sussex). In contrast, only in Arlington county did the multi-family residential average share of value exceed 19.9 percent.</p>
<p>The category with the second highest valuation in counties was commercial and industrial property. Eighty-two counties had such property valued no higher than 19.9 percent of the total assessed value of property within the locality. In general, the percentage of assessed value in counties for commercial and industrial properties was less than that for cities (though two counties, coal-rich Dickenson and Buchanan, had the highest percentage valuations of such property). Finally, agricultural property averaged the least total assessed valuation in counties, though the percentage varied greatly among the individual counties. In 30 counties, valuations associated with agricultural property made up 20 percent or more of the total assessed value within the locality. The percentage in one county (Sussex) was 82.0 percent. The taxable assessed values for agriculture were much lower than they would have been without the advantage of use value assessment, a program explained in Sections 4 and 5.</p>
</div>
<div id="effective-tax-rates" class="section level2" number="2.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> EFFECTIVE TAX RATES</h2>
<p>Tax rates are generally discussed in terms of either statutory (nominal) rates or effective rates. The statutory rate is the rate used by localities and is applied to the assessed value of a property.The effective rate is published by the Virginia Department of Taxation in their annual assessment/sales ratio study. The department derives the effective rate by multiplying the statutory tax rate by the median assessment ratio. In normal times when property values are rising, the median assessment ratio is usually less than 100 percent</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="real-property-tax-in-2019.html#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#table name: Share of Assessed Value of Real Estate by Category, 2018</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>because reassessments lag market increases and tend to be conservative. Consequently, the statutory rate is generally higher than the effective rate. However, this may not be true in difficult real estate markets. A limitation of the effective rates published by the Virginia Department of Taxation is that they are not current. The most recent year available at the present time is 2017. Despite the time lag, effective rates are important because they give a more accurate reflection of the differences in real property tax rates across localities.</p>
<p><strong>Table 2.7</strong> shows city and county average effective tax rates in the year 2017. The department makes its computation in order to control for the variance in localities’ assessment procedures and timing. Therefore, when comparing tax rates among localities, the reader may wish to consult both Tables 2.1 and 2.7. Table 2.1 shows statutory rates in 2019. Table 2.7 shows statutory and effective rates in 2017. The following text table summarizes the effective tax rates for the localities shown in Table 2.7.</p>
<p>It should also be pointed out that the Virginia Department of Taxation does not use the locally reported statutory tax rate in its computations. Instead, it calculates the statutory rate by dividing the real estate levy by the local real</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="real-property-tax-in-2019.html#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#table name: Effective Real Estate Tax Rates, 2017</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>estate <em>taxable assessed value</em>,<span class="math inline">\(^6\)</span> as reported in the local land book. This method of computing the statutory tax rate takes additional district levies into account.<span class="math inline">\(^7\)</span></p>
<p>In 2 cities and 10 counties the statutory rate was less than the effective rate. In two cities and seven counties statutory and effective rates were the same. Finally, in 34 cities and 78 counties statutory rates exceeded effective rates.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="real-property-tax-in-2019.html#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#table name: Statutory and Effective Real Estate Tax Rates, 2017</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The real property tax rates reported in Table 2.7 are a more accurate reflection of the differences among localities in tax rates on real property than those in Table 2.1 because they control for variations in assessment frequency and technique among localities. Table 2.7 also shows the latest reassessment in effect when the median ratio study was conducted, the number of sales used in the study, the median ratio, and the coefficient of dispersion.</p>
<p>The coefficient of dispersion measures how closely the individual ratios of each locality are arrayed around the median ratio. The formula for the coefficient of dispersion (CD) is:</p>
<!-- #Equation goes here -->
<p>where <span class="math display">\[X_i\]</span> represents the assessment/sales ratio for the <em>i</em>th sale in a sample of size <em>n</em>, and <span class="math display">\[X_m\]</span> represents the median ratio of the sample.<span class="math inline">\(^8\)</span> If there were no dispersion, the CD would equal zero.</p>
<p>The text table below summarizes the coefficients of dispersion tabulated for the cities and counties. Eighteen of the cities had CDs of no more than 9.9 percent. Eight had CDs between 10 percent and 14.9 percent, 7 had CDs between 15</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="real-property-tax-in-2019.html#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#table name: Coefficient of Dispersion, 2017</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and 19.9 percent, and 4 had CDs between 20 and 24.9 percent. Counties tended to vary more in the degree of dispersion. Thirteen had CDs between 5 and 9.9 percent, 18 had CDs between 10 and 14.9 percent, 25 had CDs between 15 and 19.9 percent, 26 had CDs between 20 and 24.9 percent, 11 had CDs between 25 and 29.9 percent, and 2 had CDs between 30 and 34.9 percent.</p>
<p>There is no upper limit for what is tolerable, but the International Association of Assessing Officers recommends an upper limit of 15 percent for residential properties.<span class="math inline">\(^9\)</span> Twenty-eight cities and 34 counties met the 15 percent standard.<span class="math inline">\(^10\)</span></p>
<p>As one would expect, the quality of local assessments, as measured by the CD is generally better in those localities that reassess annually, biennially, or that have just conducted a general reassessment. In 2017, of the 57 localities with CDs under 15 percent, all but 12 reassessed annually (28), biennially (10), or had just completed general reassessments (7).</p>
</div>
<div id="miscellaneous-items" class="section level2" number="2.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS</h2>
<p><strong>Table 2.8</strong> presents miscellaneous taxes and exemptions related to real property. The first is the recreation tax. The <em>Code</em> in §15.2-1807 permits localities to collect a real estate tax for recreation areas and playgrounds that is not to exceed $0.02/$100 of the assessed value of a property. This tax was reported by Charlottesville City.</p>
<p>The second column refers to the tax deferral ordinance permitted by § 58.1-3219 regarding the deferral of a portion of real estate tax increases when the tax exceeds 105 percent of the real property tax on property owned by a taxpayer in the previous year. Four localities (Charlottesville City, Richmond City, Middlesex County, and Amherst Town) reported implementing this deferral.</p>
<p>The third column refers to the establishment of a tax increment financing fund used to encourage development in certain areas and permitted by § 58.1-3245 of the <em>Code</em>. Six cities (Bristol, Charlottesville, Chesapeake, Emporia, Newport News, Virginia Beach, and Waynesboro), four counties (Arlington, Augusta, Fairfax, and Hanover), and one town (Front Royal) reported having implemented such a fund.</p>
<p>The fourth column refers to separate real property tax rates for energy-efficient buildings as permitted by § 58.1-3221.2 of the <em>Code</em>. Three cities (Charlottesville, Roanoke, and Virginia Beach) reported having special rates for such real estate.</p>
