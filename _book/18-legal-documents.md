# Legal Document Taxes

In fiscal  year  2018,  the  most  recent  year  available  from  the Auditor of Public Accounts, taxes on legal documents  accounted for 0.5 percent of total tax revenue for cities and 0.8 percent for counties. Towns do not have this tax. These are averages; the relative importance of taxes in individual localities may vary significantly. For information on individual localities, see Appendix C.

Section 58.1-3800 of the Code of Virginia authorizes the governing body of any city or county to impose a recordation tax in an amount equal to one-third of the state recordation tax. The recordation tax generally applies to real and personal property in connection with deeds of trust, mortgages, and leases, and to contracts involving the sale of rolling stock or equipment (§§ 58.1-807 and 58.1-808). 

Local governments are not permitted to impose a levy when the state recordation tax imposed is 50 cents or more (§  58.1-3800).  Consequently,  local  governments  cannot  levy a tax on such documents as certain corporate charter amendments (§ 58.1-801), deeds of release (§ 58.1-805), or deeds of partition (§ 58.1-806) as the state tax imposed is already 50 cents per $100. 

Sections  58.1-809 and 58.1-810 also specifically exempt certain types of deed modifications from being taxed. Deeds of confirmation or correction, deeds to which the only parties are husband and wife, and modifications or supplements to the  original  deeds  are  not  taxed.  Finally,  §  58.1-811  lists  a  number of exemptions to the recordation tax. 

Currently,  the  state  recordation  tax  on  the  first  \$10 million of value is 25 cents per \$100, so cities and counties can  impose  a  maximum  tax  of  8.3  cents  per  \$100  on  the  first \$10 million, one-third of the 25 cent state rate. Above $10 million there is a declining scale of charges applicable (§ 58.1-3803).

In  addition  to  a  tax  on  real  and  personal  property,  §§ 58.1-3805 and 58.1-1718 authorize cities and counties to  impose  a  tax  on  the  probate  of  every  will  or  grant  of  administration  equal  to  one-third  of  the  state  tax  on  such  probate or grant of administration. Currently, the state tax on wills and grants of administration is 10 cents per \$100 or a fraction of \$100 for estates valued at greater than $15,000 (§  58.1-1712).  Therefore,  the  maximum  local  rate  is 3.3 cents.

A  related  *state*  tax  is  levied  in  localities  associated  with  the  Northern  Virginia  Transportation  Authority.  The  tax is a grantor’s fee of \$0.15 per $100 on the value of real property property sold. This was created as part of the 2013 transportation bill.
