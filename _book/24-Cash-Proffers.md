# Cash Proffers FY 2018

In  Virginia  proffers  are  permitted  for  conditional  zoning,  “whereby a zoning reclassification may be allowed subject to  certain  conditions  proffered  by  the  zoning  applicant  for the protection of the community that are not generally applicable to land similarly zoned.” (Code of Virginia, §§ 15.2-2296  through  15.2-2302).  The  Code  §  15.2-2297  authorizes zoning ordinances to include voluntary proffers “in  writing,  by  the  owner,  of  reasonable  conditions,  prior  to a public hearing before the governing body, in addition to the regulations provided for the zoning district or zone by the ordinance, as a part of a rezoning or amendment to a zoning map” provided that the rezoning itself gives rise to the needed conditions. 

Eligibility requirements are listed in § 15.2-2298 and §   15.2-2303.   Section   15.2-2298   gives   localities   the   authority to accept proffers if: (1) the locality’s growth rate met  or  exceeded  10  percent  in  the  last  decennial  census  (2010); (2) the locality is a city which adjoins another city or  county  that  had  a  growth  rate  that  met  or  exceeded  10  percent in the last decennial census; (3) any towns located within counties that had a  growth rate that met or exceeded 10 percent in the last decennial census; and (4) any county contiguous  with  at  least  three  counties  that  had  a  growth  rate that met or exceeded 10 percent in the last decennial census.

Further  eligibility  requirements  listed  in  §  15.2-2303  permit  proffers  for  (1)  any  county  with  an  urban  county  executive  form  of  government;  (2)  any  city  next  to  or  surrounded  by  a  county  with  an  urban  county  executive  form of government; (3) any county next to a county with an urban county executive form of government; (4) any city next to or surrounded by a county contiguous to a county with  an  urban  county  executive  form  of  government;  (5)  any town within a county contiguous to a county with an urban  county  executive  form  of  government;  and  (6)  any  county  east  of  the  Chesapeake  Bay  (i.e.,  Accomack  and  Northampton  counties).  Finally,  §  15.2-2303.1  permits  proffers  for  any  county  with  a  1990  census  population  between  10,300  and  11,000  through  which  an  interstate  highway  passes.  This  section  was  meant  to  include  New  Kent County.

Proffers  may  entail  the  giving  of  property,  property  improvements,  or  cash.  Proffers  of  cash  payments  are  required  to  be  disclosed  to  the  Commission  on  Local  Government  in  accordance  with  §  15.2-2303.2.There  is  no requirement for reporting non-cash proffers, a category that  may  be  significant.  Cash  proffers  are  reported  in  an  annual commission publication[^24-1]. The study presented here covers fiscal  year  2018.  In  that  period,  the  commission  shows  a  total  of  298  localities  eligible  to  receive  cash  proffers (36 cities, 89 counties, and 177 towns). Of those, 36 reported cash proffer activity.

The  following  text  table  shows  the  total  cash  proffer  revenue expended annually from 2011 through 2018.
