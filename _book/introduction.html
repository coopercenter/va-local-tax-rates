<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Foreward</h2>
<p>This is the thirty-eighth edition of the Cooper Center’s annual publication about the tax rates of Virginia’s local governments. In addition to information about tax rates, the publication contains details about tax administration, valuation methods, and due dates. There is also information on water and sewer rates, waste disposal charges and numerous other aspects of local government finance. This comprehensive guide to local taxes is based on information gathered in the spring, summer, and early fall of 2019. The study includes all of Virginia’s 38 independent cities and 95 counties and 118 of the 190 incorporated towns. The included towns account for 92 percent of the Commonwealth’s population in towns<span class="math inline">\(^1\)</span>. The study also contains information from several outside sources, including two Department of Taxation studies, 2019 Legislative Summary and The 2017 Assessment/Sales Ratio Study, as well as Department of Taxation information on the assessed value of real estate by type of property. We also used the Auditor of Public Accounts’ Comparative Report of Local Government Revenues and Expenditures, Year Ended June 30, 2018, the Commission on Local Governments’ Report on Proffered Cash Payments and Expenditures by Virginia’s Counties, Cities and Towns, 2017-2018, and the Depart-ment of Housing and Community Development’s Virginia Enterprise Zone Program 2018 Grant Year Annual Report.</p>

<div id="organization-of-the-book" class="section level2" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Organization of the Book</h2>
<p>The study is divided into 26 sections. Section 1 is a reprint of the “Local Tax Legislation” section of the Department of Taxation’s 2019 Legislative Summary. The original Department of Taxation report is available at its website<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>. Sections 2 through 26 cover specific taxes, fees, service charges, cash proffers, enterprise zones, and financial documents on the web. Most of the data came from a detailed web-based ques-tionnaire sent to all cities, counties, and incorporated towns (see Appendix A for a printed version). Appendix B provides a listing of names, phone numbers, and email addresses, when available, of respondents and non-respondents to the questionnaire. Appendix C shows the percentage share of total local taxes represented by each specific tax for each locality based on data from the Auditor of Public Accounts for fiscal year 2018. Information is provided for each city and county and for 38 populous incorporated towns. Finally, Appendix D contains 2018 population estimates for cities, counties and towns from the Cooper Center’s Demographics Research Group. The population information is provided to give readers some perspective on the relative size of localities.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> About the Survey</h2>
<p>In 2019, localities could choose between online or printed versions of the questionnaire. The Cooper Center has made its best efforts to accurately refl ect in this report the responses of localities based on the survey or follow-up queries.</p>
<p>In the tables three dots (…) are used to show there was no response and “N/A” is used to indicate “not applicable.” Readers may use the telephone/email list in Appendix B to contact local offi cials in order to obtain clarification and additional detail.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Some Components of Local Taxes</h2>
<p>This book deals mainly with local sources of revenue for local governments. Though localities might also receive federal and state resources, an important part of local funding comes from local sources. The Auditor of Public Accounts, Comparative Report of Local Government Revenues and Expenditures provides data on these local sources. The fol-lowing analysis uses the data from their report for the year ended June 30, 2018.</p>
<p>A common misperception is that nearly all local tax revenue comes from the real property tax. True, the real property tax is the dominant source, accounting for 61.9 percent of city-county tax revenue in FY 2018, the latest year available (see text table below). But three other taxes—the personal property tax, the local option sales and use tax, and the business license tax—together accounted for 24.5 percent of total tax revenue. The remaining 14.6 percent of tax revenue came from more than a dozen other taxes.</p>

<p>There are six localities where the real property tax is not dominant. Bath and Surry counties have large power plants that pay public service corporation property taxes that overwhelm other sources. Buchanan County has rich mineral deposits subject to local severance taxes that exceed the real property tax. Covington City and Alleghany County receive large shares of revenue from machinery and tools taxes on MeadWestvaco’s large paperboard manufacturing facility. Finally, the small city of Norton, the least populous independent city in Virginia<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> (3,908 in 2018) received almost as much money from the local option sales and use tax as from the real property tax. In the remaining 127 cities and counties where the real property tax is dominant, its relative importance varies from 30.3 percent of total tax revenue in Galax City to 78.8 percent in Lancaster County (see Appendix C).</p>
<p>Thirty-six cities (two cities–Hopewell and Petersburg–did not provide information for the 2018 Comparative Report) and 95 counties imposed four of the taxes shown in the previous table—the real property tax, the personal property tax, the local option sales and use tax, and the public service corporation property tax. Most, but not all, localities imposed recordation and will taxes, consumer utility taxes, motor vehicle license taxes, and taxes on manufacturers’ machinery and tools. Nonetheless, as shown in the next text table, there are a number of taxes, a few of them signifi cant sources of revenue, which are not levied by all localities. Also, some of the taxes are used so sparingly that their revenue yield is very low.</p>

<p>There are three major reasons why local governments do not to impose some taxes: (1) The locality lacks a tax base for a particular tax (e.g., a locality must have a bank in order to apply a bank stock tax and a locality must have taxable mineral deposits to impose coal, oil, and gas taxes). (2) The locality is faced with state restrictions (e.g., county excise taxes on hotel and motel room rental have tax rate restrictions imposed by the state; county restaurant meals taxes must be approved in a voter referendum; tobacco taxes are permitted in only two counties; and county admissions taxes are subject to many restrictions). In regard to the busi-ness, professional, and occupational license tax (BPOL tax), counties must choose either the BPOL tax or the merchants’ capital tax. Counties are not permitted to impose a business license tax within the boundaries of an incorporated town situated within the county without permission of the town. This means that counties with large shares of business activity within towns are motivated to impose a merchants’ capital tax that can be applied countywide. (3) The locality chooses not to impose a permitted tax (e.g., Richmond City, a community with a large cigarette manufacturing plant, has not adopted a consumer tobacco tax even though all cities are granted the authority to levy such a tax).</p>

<td>#### Local License Tax on Mobile Food Units
Senate Bill 1425 (Chapter 791) provides that when the owner of a new business that operates a mobile food unit has paid a license tax as required by the locality in which the mobile food unit is registered, the owner is not required to pay a license tax to any other locality for conducting business from such mobile food unit in such a locality.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>This exemption from paying the license tax in other localities expires two years after the payment of the initial license tax in the locality in which the mobile food unit is registered. During the two year exemption period, the owner is entitled to exempt up to three mobile food units from license taxation in other localities. However, the owner of the mobile food unit is required to register with the Commissioner of the Revenue or Director of Finance in any locality in which he conducts business from such mobile food unit, regardless of whether the owner is exempt from paying license tax in the locality.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>This Act defines “mobile food unit” as a restaurant that is mounted on wheels and readily moveable from place to place at all times during operation. It also defines “new business” as a business that locates for the first time to do business in a locality. A business will not be deemed a new business based on a merger, acquisition, similar business combination, name change, or a change to its business form.</td>
