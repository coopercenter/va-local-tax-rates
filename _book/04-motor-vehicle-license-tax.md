# Motor Vehicle Local License Tax 2019

In fiscal year 2018, the most recent year available from the Auditor of Public Accounts, the motor vehicle local license tax,  popularly  known  as  the  local  decal  tax,  even  though  many  of  the  localities  imposing  the  tax  no  longer  use  a  decal as evidence of payment, accounted for 1.1 percent of the total tax revenue for cities, 1.1 percent for counties and 2.0 percent for large towns. These are averages; the relative importance of this tax in individual cities, counties and large towns  varies  significantly.  For  information  on  individual  localities see Appendix C.

|   Section  46.2-752  of  the  *Code  of  Virginia*  authorizes  cities,  counties,  and  towns  to  levy  a  license  tax  on  motor  vehicles, trailers, and semitrailers. The amount of the tax may not be greater than the tax imposed by the state. Currently, the    base  registration  fees  for  non-commercial  passenger  vehicles are \$33 for vehicles under 4,000 pounds and \$38 for heavier vehicles (§ 46.2-694.2). Motorcycle fees are \$18 with a \$3 surcharge included [§ 46.2-694 (A) (10)]. The *Code* stipulates similar guidelines for commercial vehicles, buses, trailers, and other motor vehicles. The *Code* also provides for additional fees for specified government services, such as \$6.25 for emergency medical service (EMS) programs [*Code  of  Virginia*  §  46.2-694  (A)  (13)  and  *2014 Appropriations  Act*  §  3-6.02]  to  be  paid  to  the  state  treasury  and  provides  for  a  $1.50  addition  for  the  official motor vehicle safety inspection program to be paid at registration (§ 46.2-1168).

|   No  locality  may  impose  a  license  tax  on  any  vehicle  when  the  owner  pays  a  similar  tax  to  the  locality  in  which  the  vehicle  is  normally  stored.  Furthermore,  no  locality  may  impose  a  local  license  tax  on  any  vehicle  that  is  owned  by  a  nonresident  of  such  locality  and  is  used  exclusively  for  pleasure  or  personal  transportation  (i.e.,  for  non-business  uses).  For  example,  the  tax  would  not  apply  to  a  personal  vehicle  owned  by  a  nonresident  college  student  and  used  only  for  pleasure  or  personal  transportation.  Vehicles  used  for  state  business  by  nonresident  officials,  dealer  demonstration  vehicles  and  the  vehicles  of  common  carriers  are  also  exempt from local license taxes.
|
|   The situs for the assessment of motor vehicles is clarified in  §  58.1.3511.  Business  vehicles  with  a  weight  of  10,000  pounds or less are considered to be in the jurisdiction in which the  owner  of  the  business:  (1)  is  required  to  file  a  tangible  personal property tax return for any vehicle used in the business, and (2) has a definite place of business from which the use of the business vehicle is directed or controlled.
|
|   If a town within a county levies a motor vehicle license tax, the county must credit the owner with the tax paid to the  town.  Also,  if  the  town  tax  is  equal  to  the  maximum  allowed by law, then the county may not impose any further tax.  Likewise,  no  county  license  tax  may  be  imposed  on  vehicles that are subject to license taxes imposed by a town constituting a separate school division (§46.2-752)$^1$.

|   **Table  15.1**  presents  the  local  motor  vehicle  license  taxes  on  automobiles,  motorcycles,  and  trucks.  Column  one indicates the date that the fee must be paid or a decal, if applicable, must be affixed to a motor vehicle to denote payment  of  license  fees.  Thirty-two  cities  and  83  counties  reported  imposing  the  tax.  Of  the  reporting  towns,  103  said  they  levied  the  tax.  The  second  column  gives  the tax rate on private passenger vehicles. Most localities levy a fl at tax between \$15 and \$30 for passenger vehicles under  4,000  pounds.  The  table  also  shows  the  exemption  status  for  elderly  or  disabled  persons.  Seven  localities offer tax relief for the elderly, while 30 exempt the disabled from this tax. The final two columns give the tax rates on motorcycles and trucks. The tax ranges from \$3 to \$35 for motorcycles and from \$3 up to \$250 (depending on weight) for trucks.

|   Cities had a median license tax of \$27.00; the median tax for both counties and towns was \$25. For cities the mean license tax for private passenger vehicles was \$28.09. The first quartile measure was \$25 while the third quartile was \$32.25.  For  counties,  the  mean  was  \$26.67.  The  first and third  quartiles  were  \$23.00  and  \$30.00,  respectively.  For  towns,  the  mean  was  \$23.18.  The  first  and  third  quartiles  were \$20 and $25 respectively.
|
|   **Table 15.2** lists whether localities require the display of decals and whether localities permit special exemptions from paying the motor vehicle license tax other than those for the elderly and disabled. Twenty-six cities, 78 counties, and 62 towns reported granting payment exemptions. The most popular category for exemption was for local fire and rescue department members. 
|
|   In recent years, many localities have dispensed with the decal  because  new  technology  has  allowed  them  to  track  payments without the use of the decal. Most now collect the motor vehicle license tax along with the personal property tax on motor vehicles. So far, 30 cities, 83 counties, and 81 towns reported they no longer required decal placement on automobile windshields.
