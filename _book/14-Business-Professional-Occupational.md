# Business, Professional, and Occupational License Tax

In fiscal year 2018, the most recent year available from the Auditor of Public Accounts, business license taxes, of which the business, professional, and occupational license tax (commonly referred to as the BPOL tax) makes up the largest part, accounted for 6.0 percent of tax revenue for cities, 3.4 percent for counties, and 11.9 percent for large towns. These are averages; the relative importance of the tax varies for individual cities, counties and towns. In fact, only slightly over half of the counties employ the tax. Others use the merchants’ capital tax instead. Four counties (Amherst, Hanover, Louisa, and Southampton) reported using both taxes, maintaining the merchants’ capital tax for retailers and the BPOL tax for other types of businesses. For information on individual localities, see Appendix C.

Localities are authorized to impose a local license tax on businesses, professions, and occupations operating within their jurisdictions unless they already levy a tax on merchants’ capital.The BPOL tax is sanctioned by §§ 58.1-3700 through 58.1-3735 of the *Code of Virginia*. The *Code* establishes the dates between March 1 and May 1 as the time by which businesses must apply for a license. County BPOL taxes do not apply within the limits of an incorporated town unless the town grants the county authority to do so (§ 58.1-3711). Localities may charge a fee to each business for the issuance of a license. Each business classification such as retail or contracting, has a specific tax rate which cannot exceed maximums set by the state guidelines. Businesses pay the tax rate for the amount of gross receipts within each classification.

Although revised guidelines in January 1997 made administration of the BPOL tax more uniform in terms of due dates, penalties, interest, appeals, and definitions of situs, localities retained some flexibility. In 2000, the 1997 guidelines were updated. They are viewable on the internet site, http://townhall.virginia.gov/L/GetFile.cfm?File=C:\TownHall\docroot\GuidanceDocs\161\GDoc_TAX_2537_v1.pdf.

In 2011 the General Assembly passed a law allowing localities the option of imposing the tax on either gross receipts or the Virginia taxable income of the business. This option did not apply to certain public service corporations required to pay the 1/2 of 1 percent utility tax, which is considered a form of BPOL (see Section 11). The legislature also permitted relief from the BPOL tax, allowing localities to exempt new business from the tax for up to two years and second. allowing localities to exempt unprofitable businesses from the tax.

Localities may still determine how many separate licenses they issue to a business and whether to charge a fee for each business location or only one fee for a business with multiple locations. Some localities charge no fee or charge different fees depending on a firm’s gross receipts. Some localities charge a minimum tax instead of a fee. For example, if a locality had a minimum license tax of \$30 then businesses with gross receipts below the threshold would pay $30 instead of a smaller amount based on gross receipts. In addition, there are some localities that impose *both* a license fee and a tax rate on businesses with gross receipts above the threshold.

The BPOL tax is collected by all cities and 51 of the 95 counties. The tax is also widely used by incorporated towns; 105 towns reported using the BPOL tax. The specific localities that impose the tax are listed in **Table 14.1** along with information regarding due dates, license fees, and thresholds.

For most localities, the filing and payment dates are March 1st, though there is quite a bit of variance from that date. Of the cities, 18 reported requiring a license fee, either by business or by location. Twenty-eight counties and 57 towns also reported requiring license fees of some sort. Finally, 20 cities, 33 counties, and 17 towns reported having a tax threshold requirement based on gross receipts.

**Table 14.2** lists the fees, minimum tax, and an explanation of the fee structures provided by the localities in the survey. Thirty-two cities reported having either a fee or a minimum tax, as did 41 counties and 98 towns.

**Table 14.3** shows specific tax rates by business classification for each locality. All 38 cities, 45 counties, and 98 towns reported having a tax on at least one business classification. An overview of the general practices of Virginia localities is shown in the text table below. Combining data from tables 14.2 and 14.3, it lists the median license fee and median gross receipts tax rate for cities, counties, and towns. If a locality reported different fees due to differences in total gross receipts, the median figures were calculated using the highest fee amount given because that provides an estimate of the greatest impact on the payer.

Only the localities that reported a fee or a tax rate in a particular category were included in the calculation of the medians in the following text table.

The median tax rates for the cities matched the maximum rates permitted by the state—\$0.16 per \$100 of gross receipts for contracting; \$0.20 for retail; \$0.36 for repair, personal, and business services; and \$0.58 for financial, real estate, and professional services. The median figures for counties and towns were less than those of the cities, indicating that counties and towns did not generally apply the maximum rates permitted by Virginia law.

The median rate of \$0.11 on wholesalers for cities was well above the state maximum of \$0.05 per \$100 of purchases. Cities are presumed to operate under grandfather clauses that allow them to impose higher rates. The median rate on wholesalers for counties and towns was \$0.05 per \$100.

The median license fee, which is generally imposed only upon businesses below the gross receipts tax threshold, was \$50 for the cities, \$40 for counties, and \$30 for towns.

One business classification not presented in Table 14.3 is that of rental property due to the small number of localities reporting it. Localities are permitted to charge a license fee, or levy a BPOL tax, on businesses renting real property. In 2019, only 24 localities reported taxing such businesses. They were the cities of Alexandria, Bristol, Fairfax, Falls Church, Fredericksburg, and Portsmouth; the counties of Albemarle, Arlington, Augusta, Fairfax, King George, Loudoun, Nelson, Pulaski, and Wythe; and the towns of Bridgewater, Chatham, Goshen, Haymarket, Narrows, Purcellville, Round Hill, Saint Paul, and Vienna.

**Table 14.4** lists taxes and fees on peddlers and itinerant merchants. All of the cities, 50 counties, and 93 towns reported some form of tax on peddlers. Annual fees charged by cities for retail peddling ranged anywhere from \$30 to \$500. Taxes on retail itinerant merchants and wholesale peddlers also ranged from \$30 to \$500, with some cities charging according to gross receipts and other cities according to gross purchases. Annual charges by counties ranged from a \$1 minimum fee to \$500, while towns charged anywhere from \$10 to \$500 per year.
