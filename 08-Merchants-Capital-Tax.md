# Merchants' Capital Tax

The merchants’ capital tax accounted for 0.1 percent of tax revenue for counties and less than 0.1 percent for towns in fiscal year 2018, the most recent year available from the Auditor of Public Accounts. No cities employ the tax and only 41 of the 95 counties use it exclusively. Four counties use the tax in conjunction with the business, professional, and occupational license (BPOL) tax. The other counties rely solely on the BPOL tax.The relative importance of the merchants’ capital tax varies in the localities that collect it. For information on individual localities, see Appendix C.

The *Code of Virginia*, §§ 58.1-3509 and 58.1-3510, provides that localities may impose a local tax on merchants’ capital. Localities also have the option to exempt specific types of merchants from part or all of the tax. Merchants’ capital is defined as the inventory of stock on hand, daily rental motor vehicles as defined in § 58.1-2401, and all other taxable personal property (except tangible personal property not for sale as merchandise, which is taxed as tangible personal property), excluding money on hand and on deposit.

Property held for rental in a short-term rental business could be subject to the merchants’ capital tax. However, such property may also be classified under § 58.1-3510.4 making it subject to a separate freestanding tax. Consequently, daily rental property is discussed in this section and in Section 19, Miscellaneous Taxes. 

In 2018, a separate classification was created for merchant’ capital of wholesalers inventory normally contained in a structure of 100,000 square feet, with at least 100,000 square feet used to contain the inventory. 

According to § 58.1-3704 of the *Code*, no locality may impose a merchants’ capital tax if it also imposes a BPOL tax on retail merchants. A number of localities impose both of these taxes, but they do not use the BPOL tax for retail sales. 

In 1978, the General Assembly enacted legislation (§ 58.1-3509 of the *Code*) that froze merchants’ capital tax rates at their January 1, 1978 level. Localities that had raised their rates and/or assessment ratios after February 1, 1977 were required to roll back their rates on July 1, 1978 to the February 1, 1977 rate and refund any amount in excess. (See *Virginia, Acts of Assembly*, 1978, c. 817, cl. 2, p. 1407.) While the enabling legislation prohibits localities from raising the merchants’ capital tax rates, it does not prohibit localities from lowering the rates if they choose to do so. Thus, a locality may still lower the tax liability of a merchant by reducing the statutory rate, the assessment ratio, or both.

As previously noted, the merchants’ capital tax is used exclusively by 41 counties. It is also imposed by nine towns responding to the survey. In contrast, 44 counties and all of the cities report using the BPOL tax for retail merchants in lieu of the merchants’ capital tax. Four counties (Amherst, Hanover, Louisa, and Southampton) use both the BPOL tax and the merchants’ capital tax, maintaining the latter tax on retailers. Seven counties (Bath, Culpeper, Fluvanna, Northampton, Patrick, Rappahannock, and Washington) reported having neither tax.

Those counties employing the merchants’ capital tax generally have one or more incorporated towns that are business centers and that impose the BPOL tax. This precludes the counties from using the BPOL tax within the town boundaries. In contrast, counties can impose the merchants’ capital tax within town boundaries even if a town has a BPOL tax. Most of the towns that tax business use the BPOL tax.

**Table 8.1** shows the statutory (nominal) tax rates per \$100 for the counties and towns, the value used for assessment, and the percentage of value. As shown in the text table, the unweighted mean of the statutory tax rate for counties was \$1.93 per \$100 of assessed value. The median was \$1.00 and the first and third quartiles were \$0.69 and \$2.85, respectively. The unweighted mean of the statutory tax rate for towns was \$0.49 per \$100 of assessed value. The median was \$0.46, and the first and third quartiles were \$0.20 and \$0.72, respectively.

A majority of the localities that impose the merchants’ capital tax compute the assessment of capital on a percentage of the original cost. Of the 45 counties and 10 towns listed in the table, 43 counties and 5 towns reported using original cost as a basis for assessment. Information on statutory tax rates of towns that did not respond to the survey can be found in the Virginia Department of Taxation’s local tax rates survey for tax year 2016, available on the Virginia Department of Taxation’s website, http://www.tax.virginia.gov/. Please note that the rates in the department’s survey are for the 2014 tax year; it is the most recent information available for towns that did not respond to the Cooper Center survey. 

**Table 8.2** lists the components of the merchants’ capital tax imposed by the localities. Of the 45 counties that impose the tax, all reported imposing the inventory tax component of the tax. Twenty-one impose the rental vehicle tax. Finally, 22 counties reported imposing the short-term rental tax.

All reporting towns used the inventory tax component. None reported imposing a short-term rental tax. Amherst, Timberville and Pembroke reported imposing the rental vehicle tax.
